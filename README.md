# se-day-2-git-and-github
## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Imagine you're writing a story and keep saving it as "Story_v1", "Story_v2_Final", then "Story_FinalFinal". It gets messy beyond. Version control does this automatically for code and in a smarter way

Version Control is a system that tracks changes to files (like code) over time. I can say it is a "time machine" for your project. Key ideas involve, 

Repository (Repo): A project folder that stores all files + their history.
Example: A shared Google Drive folder for your team’s code.

Commit: Saving a snapshot of changes. Each commit has a message like "Fixed login bug".
Example: Saving a game checkpoint before a boss fight. If you lose, you reload the checkpoint.

Branch: A copy of the code where you can work without affecting the main (master) version.
Example: Writing a risky plot twist in a book draft. If it flops, the main story stays safe.

Merge: Combining changes from branches into the main code.
Example: Blending your co-author’s chapter edits into the final book.

Why GitHub?

GitHub is like "Facebook for code" but way more useful. It hosts Git (the version control system) repositories and adds collaboration tools making it popular for; 

Ease of Use: Drag-and-drop file uploads, visual change tracking.

Pull Requests: Propose changes. Teammates review code before merging.

Community: Millions of open-source projects (e.g., React, Python) live here.

Backup: Your code is stored in the cloud, safe from laptop crashes.

Analogy: Google Docs lets multiple people edit a file. GitHub does this for code but with superpowers (e.g., resolving conflicts when two people edit the same line).

How Version Control maintain integrity
Track Changes: See who edited what and when.
Example: A bug appears? Check the commit history to find who added it and revert it.

Avoid Chaos: No more "final_v2_updated.zip" files. Everyone works in branches.
Example: Two developers add features A and B separately. Merge both without conflicts.

Disaster Recovery: Roll back to a stable version if things break.
Example: A new feature crashes the app? Revert to yesterday’s working version in seconds.

Accountability: Each commit is tagged with a name. No more "Who broke this?!"
Example: Like tracking edits in a shared doc, but for code.

Real-World Situation
Me and a friend built a website. Without version control:
Email code back and forth. Accidentally overwrite each other’s work.
With GitHub:
You both create branches. Work on the header (me) and footer (friend).
Submit pull requests. Review each other’s code, then merge. No chaos.



## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?

Step 1. 

Sign In to GitHub
Go to github.com and log in. If you’re new, sign up (it’s free).
Similarity: Think of this as creating an account for a social media app, but for coding.

Step 2. 

Create a new repository
Click the + icon in the top-right corner → New repository.

Key decision to make:

Repository Name
Name it something clear, like todo-list-app (no spaces, use hyphens).
Example: Naming a file Sales_2023 instead of stuff.docx.

Public vs. Private
Public: Anyone can see your code (great for open-source projects).
Private: Only you and collaborators can see it (use for secret projects).
Accidentally making a company project public could leak sensitive code!

Initialize with a README
A README.md file is like a cover page for your project.
It’s where you explain what your project does.
Example: Imagine leaving sticky notes on a folder so others know what’s inside.

Add .gitignore
A .gitignore file tells GitHub to ignore unnecessary files (e.g., temporary files, logs).
Choose a template (e.g., Python) to auto-ignore common junk files.
Example: Telling your friend to ignore the scribbled drafts and only read the final essay.

Choose a License
A license is a rulebook for how others can use your code.
MIT License is common for open-source (lets anyone use your code freely).
Why it matters: No license = others might not legally be allowed to use your code.

Step 3.

Create the Repository
Click the green Create Repository button. Congrats! Your repo is live

Step 4.

Connect Your Local Code to GitHub
Now you need to link your computer’s code folder to this GitHub repo:
Copy the repo’s URL (look for the HTTPS or SSH link on the repo page).
Open your project folder on your computer (e.g., todo-list-app).
Run these commands in the terminal:

git init  # Turns your folder into a Git repo
git remote add origin (PASTE_THE_REPO_URL_HERE) # Links to GitHub
git add .  # Stages all your files
git commit -m "First commit: initial setup"  # Saves a snapshot
git push -u origin main  # Uploads code to GitHub

Similarity: Uploading photos to Google Photos so others can see them.


Key dangers to avoid

Forgetting the README: Your repo looks empty and confusing without it.

Skipping .gitignore: You might upload passwords (.env files) or huge log files by accident.

Wrong license: If you want credit, avoid “No License” (MIT or Apache are safer).

Real-World Example:

You’re building a weather app.

Repo name: weather-app

Public: Yes (you want feedback).

.gitignore: Python template (ignores_pycache_, .env).

License: MIT (lets others learn from your code).

After pushing, your GitHub repo becomes the “source of truth” for your project. Teammates can clone it, and you can track changes over time.


## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?

A README Matters because it is:

First Impressions:
The README is the first thing people see when they open your repo.
Example: Think of it like a shop window if it’s empty or messy, people walk away.

Self-Documentation:
Code isn’t self-explanatory. A README explains what your project does, why it exists, and how to use it.
Likeness: Leaving a note for your roommate about how to use the new coffee machine.

Saves Time (Yours and Others’):
Without a README, collaborators waste hours figuring out how to run or debug your code.
Example: Imagine a recipe without measurements.

Future-Proofing:
You’ll forget how your own code works in 6 months. The README jogs your memory.

What to Include in a Great README

Project Title and Tagline
A clear name and a 1-sentence description.
Example: # WeatherBot  *A Discord bot that sends real-time weather updates. *  

Table of Contents (For Longer READMEs)
Help users jump to sections like “Installation” or “Troubleshooting.”

Installation Instructions
Step-by-step commands to set up the project.
Example:
Installation
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourname/WeatherBot.git`  
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`  
3. Add your API key to `.env`  

Usage Guide
How to run/use the project. Include code snippets or screenshots.
Example:
Usage  
Start the bot: `npm start`  
Command: `!weather Nairobi` → Bot replies with Toronto’s forecast.  

Contributing Guidelines
Rules for others who want to help (e.g., how to report bugs, code style).
Example:
Contributing  
- Fork the repo and create a feature branch.  
- Follow the (Code Style Guide)(STYLE_GUIDE.md).  

License
State the license (e.g., MIT, GPL). Without this, others can’t legally reuse your code.

Badges
Tiny icons showing project health:
Build status: 
Test coverage: 
Why: They’re like nutrition labels—quick info at a glance.

Contact Info
How to reach you (e.g., email, Twitter) for questions or feedback.

How a README Boosts Collaboration

Onboarding Speed: New team members can start contributing faster.
Example: A README with setup steps lets a developer run the app in 5 minutes instead of 5 hours.

Reduces Repetitive Questions:
No more Slack messages like “How do I install this?” or “What does this project even do?”

Clear Expectations:
Contribution guidelines prevent messy pull requests (e.g., “Please write tests for new features”).

Documentation Consistency:
Everyone follows the same setup, avoiding “But it works on my machine!” conflicts.


Real-World Example: A Calculator App README

CalculatorApp  
*A simple calculator built with React. *  
!(Calculator Screenshot)(screenshot.png)  

Installation  
1. Clone this repo.  
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.  
3. Start the app: `npm start`.  

Usage  
- Click buttons to perform calculations.  
- Press `C` to clear.  

Contributing  
- Open an issue to discuss changes first.  
- Write tests for new features.  

License  
MIT License.

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?

The Core Differences:

Public Repository:
Anyone can view, clone, and contribute (with your permission).
Like posting a recipe online for the world to use and improve.
Example: Open-source projects like Python or Excel.

Private Repository:
Only invited collaborators can view or edit.
Like keeping a secret family recipe in a locked drawer.
Example: A company’s internal payroll software.

Advantages & Disadvantages

Public Repositories

Pros:
Free (Forever): GitHub doesn’t charge for public repos.
Community Power: Strangers can spot bugs, suggest features, or submit fixes (via pull requests).
Example: A developer in South Africa might improve your app’s translation.
Resume Booster: Showcases your skills to potential employers.
Transparency: Builds trust (e.g., “This project has no hidden malware!”).

Cons:
No Secrets Allowed: Accidentally upload an API key or password? The whole internet can see it.
Limited Control: You’ll need to manage spammy contributions or trolls.
Competitive Risk: Rivals can copy your code (though licenses can help).


Private Repositories

Pros:
Privacy & Security: Perfect for sensitive projects (e.g., unreleased apps, client work).
Team Control: Add/remove collaborators as needed.
Example: Only your startup’s CTO and lead developer have access.
GitHub’s Free Tier: Individuals get unlimited free private repos (with up to 3 collaborators).

Cons:
Closed Doors: No community contributions—you’re limited to your team’s skills.
Paid Plans for Teams: Need more than 3 collaborators? You’ll pay $4+/month per user.
Less Visibility: Harder to attract external talent or get feedback.


When to use which;

Public Repos are great for:
Open-Source Projects: Let the world help you build something amazing.
Example: A free budgeting app that anyone can customize.
Learning & Portfolios: Share code to get mentorship or job opportunities.
Public Demos: Let users preview your code before buying a product.

Private Repos shine for:
Startups/Companies: Protect intellectual property (IP) or client work.
Example: The secret algorithm behind TikTok’s recommendation system.
Class Projects: Keep coursework hidden from copy-pasters.
Experiments: Test wild ideas without judgment from strangers.

Real-world situations

Public Repo in Action:
You build a Chrome extension to block ads.
Make it public, developers worldwide submit fixes, and users trust it’s safe.

Private Repo in Action:
Your team is building the next Uber-for-Dogs app.
Keep it private, competitors can’t steal your code before launch.


## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?

A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific time. Imagine you’re writing a book:
Every time you finish a chapter; you save it as “Chapter 1 Draft.”
If you later delete a paragraph and regret it, you can reload that saved draft.
Commits work the same way for code. Each one saves:
What changed (e.g., “Added login button”).
Who made the change (your name/email).
When it happened (timestamp).

Step-by-Step for Commit

1. Install Git

Download Git from git-scm.com
Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal).
Check if Git works
git --version  
If you see a version number (e.g., git version 2.37.1), you’re ready!

2. Set Up Git (One-Time Setup)

Tell Git who you are (so commits are tagged with your name):
git config --global user.name "Ronald88881"  
git config --global user.email "kinyeronald@email.com"  

3. Create a Project Folder

Make a folder for your project:
mkdir todo-list  
cd todo-list  

Create a file (e.g., index.html) and write some code.
Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body> 
  </body>  
</html>  

4. Initialize a Git Repository
Turn your folder into a Git-tracked project:
git init  
This creates a hidden. git folder (like a time machine for your code).

5. Stage Your Changes
Git uses a “staging area” to decide which files to commit.
git add index.html  

What this does: Adds index.html to the “staging area” (like putting items in a shopping cart).

To add all files in the folder:
git add.  

6. Commit Your Changes
Save the staged files as a commit:
git commit -m "Create homepage HTML structure"  

-m lets you add a commit message. Be descriptive!
Bad message: “Update file”
Good message: “Add heading and basic HTML boilerplate”

7. Connect to GitHub
Now, push your local commit to GitHub:

Create a new repo on GitHub (see previous answer for steps).
Link your local repo to GitHub:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list.git  

Push your commit:
git push -u origin main  

Refresh your GitHub repo page


How Commits Help Track Changes

Time Travel: Revert to an older commit if you break something.
Example:
git log  # View commit history  
git checkout abc123  # Restore code from commit 

Accountability: See who changed what and why.

Collaboration: Teammates can see your changes and build on them.


## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.

1. Creating a Branch
What it does: A branch is a copy of the main project (usually called main or master) at a specific point in time.
How to do it:
git checkout -b my-new-feature  # Creates a new branch and switches to it
Example: If you’re adding a login page, you’d create a branch-like feature/login to isolate your work.

2. Using a Branch

Work in isolation: Make changes, add files, or delete code here without affecting the main branch.
Commit often: Save snapshots of your progress:
git add.  # Stages changes
git commit -m "Added login button" # Saves them in your branch

This is like saving drafts of your work. If you break something, the main project stays safe.

3. Merging Branches
When your feature is ready, you merge it back into main:

Push your branch to GitHub:
git push origin my-new-feature

Create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub: This is like saying, “Hey team, review my changes!”
Teammates can comment, suggest tweaks, or approve.
GitHub checks for conflicts (e.g., if someone else edited the same code).

Resolve conflicts (if any):
if two people change the same line of code, Git will flag it. You`ll manually pick which version to keep: 
Head Your code ==Their code to the, main
Delete the conflict markers (<<<, ===, >>>) and keep the correct code, then commit again.

Merge the PR: Once approved, click “Merge” on GitHub. Your changes are now part of main!

Why Branching is Crucial for Collaboration

Avoid chaos: No one steps on each other’s toes.

Test safely: Experiment in your branch without breaking the main project.

Code reviews: PRs let teams discuss changes before merging.

Track history: Branches make it easy to see who did what and when.


Real-World Example:

Alice works on a payment-button branch.
Bob fixes a typo in the fix/typo branch.
Both finishes, create PRs, get feedback, and merge into main. The main project stays stable while work happens in parallel.


## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?

A pull requests is a request to merge your code (from your branch) into the main project (like main). It’s GitHub’s way of saying:
“I’ve built something new. Let’s discuss it!”
“Can someone check if this breaks anything?”
“Does this fit with what the team is doing?”

Why PRs Matter for Collaboration

Code Reviews Made Easy:
Teammates can comment on specific lines of code (e.g., “This variable name is confusing”).
Example: You added a new login feature, but a reviewer notices a typo in an error message. They flag it, and you fix it before merging.

Avoid Chaos:
Without PRs, everyone would edit the main code directly. Imagine 10 people editing the same Google Doc at once, a total mess!
PRs keep the main branch stable and clean.

Automated Checks:
GitHub can run tests, check for style issues, or scan for security problems automatically when you create a PR.
Example: If your code fails a test, GitHub blocks the merge until you fix it.

Documentation:
PRs leave a history of why changes were made. Years later, you can look back and see discussions like, “We added this button because users kept getting lost.”

Typical Steps to Create & Merge a PR

Step 1: Create a Branch

Start by working in your own branch (like a personal workspace):
git checkout -b my-cool-feature  # Create and switch to a new branch  
(Example: You’re adding a “dark mode” toggle to a website.)

Step 2: Code, Commit, Push

Make your changes.

Save (“commit”) them to your branch:
git add.  
git commit -m "Added dark mode toggle button"  

Push the branch to GitHub:
git push origin my-cool-feature  

Step 3: Open the Pull Request on GitHub

Go to your repo on GitHub. You’ll see a button to “Compare & pull request” for your new branch.

Write a clear title/description:
“What”: Add dark mode toggle
“Why”: Users requested a way to reduce eye strain at night.

Step 4: Review & Discuss

Teammates (or even yourself!) review the code:
They can leave comments on specific lines.
Example: “Should we make the toggle button bigger? It’s hard to see on mobile.”

Use GitHub’s “Suggest Changes” feature to propose fixes directly.

Update your branch if changes are requested:
Fix the code, commit again, and push. The PR updates automatically.

Step 5: Merge the PR

Once approved, click “Merge pull request”.

GitHub combines your branch into main.

Delete the old branch (like cleaning up after moving furniture).

Real-Life Example

Scenario: Alice adds a “Forgot Password” link to the login page.

PR Steps:

She works in a branch called feature/forgot-password.

Creates a PR titled: “Add password recovery link”.

Bob reviews it and says: “The link color blends with the background. Can we make it blue?”

Alice updates the color, pushes the fix, and Bob approves.

PR is merged. Now all users see the new link!



## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?

Forking vs. Cloning: What’s The Difference between Forking and Cloning

Forking:

Creates a copy of the entire project under your GitHub account.
You can edit this copy freely, and it stays linked to the original (like a “sibling” project).
Example: You fork userA/awesome-project to create your-username/awesome-project.

Cloning:

Downloads a copy of the project to your local computer (your laptop).
You’re just working offline. It doesn’t create a new standalone project on GitHub.
Example: git clone https://github.com/userA/awesome-project.git → code lives on your machine.

Similarity:
Forking is like photocopying a library book and owning your copy.
Cloning is like borrowing the book to read at home (you still have to return it).

When would you Fork a Repository?

Contributing to Open-Source Projects
You can’t edit someone else’s project directly (unless they give you access).
Fork it - make changes - propose updates via pull request (PR).
Example: Fixing a bug in a popular tool like VS Code. You: Fork microsoft/vscode - now you have your-username/vscode.
Fix the bug in your fork.
Send a PR to the original repo. The owners review and (hopefully) merge it!

Personal Experiments
Want to tweak a project for your needs without affecting the original?
Example: Forking a react-todo-list template to build a grocery-list app.

Backing Up or Archiving
Fork a project you rely on in case the original gets deleted.

Learning from Others
Fork a repo, dissect the code, and add comments/notes for yourself.

How to Fork a Repository

Go to the GitHub repo you want to fork (e.g., github.com/userA/awesome-project).

Click the “Fork” button (top-right).
GitHub creates your-username/awesome-project.

Clone your fork to your computer:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/awesome-project.git  

Make changes, commit, and push to your fork:
git add.  
git commit -m "Added new feature"  
git push origin main  

To propose changes to the original repo:
Create a pull request from your fork to the original (e.g., userA/awesome-project).

Key Scenarios where Forking shines

You’re Not a Project Member: Open-source contributors have to fork to suggest changes.

Diverging Ideas: You want to take a project in a new direction (e.g., turning a blog template into a podcast platform).

Safe Playground: Test risky changes without breaking the original code.


## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

An Issue is a task, bug report, or idea that needs attention. Think of it like a sticky note that says:
“The login button crashes on mobile!” (Bug)
“We need a dark mode feature.” (Task)
“Should we switch to a new database?” (Discussion)

Why Issues Matter

Track Bugs:
Users or teammates can report problems.
Example: Issue #45: App crashes when uploading large files.
Assign the issue to a developer, add labels like bug or high priority, and track fixes.

Break Down Tasks:
Split big projects into small, manageable steps.
Example:
Issue #1: Design homepage header
Issue #2: Add contact form

Centralize Discussions:
Teammates comment directly on issues to brainstorm solutions.
Example: “Should we use React or Vue for this feature?”

Assign Responsibility:
Tag team members (e.g., “@Ronald, can you handle this?”).

Project Boards
A Project Board is like a Kanban board with columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done). Drag and drop issues between columns to track progress.

Why Project Boards Rock

See the Big Picture:
Example columns:
Backlog (Ideas) - In Progress – Review - Done
No more “Wait, what’s everyone working on?”

Prioritize Tasks:
Move high-priority issues to the top (e.g., “Fix security bug before launch”).

Automate Workflows:
GitHub can auto-move issues when you link PRs or add labels.
Example: When a PR is merged, its linked issue moves to Done.

Real-world example: Building a Weather App

Step 1: Create Issues
Issue #101: API connection fails in cold weather. (Bug)
Issue #102: Add temperature unit toggle (°F/°C). (Feature)
Issue #103: Improve loading animation. (Enhancement)

Step 2: Organize on a Project Board
To Do list (#101 Bug) – In Progress (Feature) - Done  (#103 Done!)
  
Step 3: Collaborate
Ronald fixes #101, moves it to Done.
Bob comments on #102: “Should the toggle be in the settings menu or header?”

How These Tools Supercharge Collaboration

No More “I Forgot!”
Issues act as reminders. If a bug is reported, it won’t get lost in a chat thread.

Transparency
Everyone sees what’s being worked on, avoiding duplicate efforts.

Async-Friendly
Remote teams in different time zones can update progress without meetings.

Accountability
Assigned issues = clear ownership. No more “Whose job was this?”

Examples of Enhanced Workflows

Bug Triage
Label issues as critical, low-priority, or needs-more-info.
Use filters to focus on urgent fixes before a launch.

Sprint Planning
Create a board for a 2-week sprint. Drag issues into Sprint Backlog.

Open-Source Projects
New contributors can grab good first issue labeled tasks to start helping.

How to Get Started

Create an Issue:

Click Issues → New Issue. Add a title, description, labels, and assignees.
Example:
Title: [Bug] Login page crashes on Safari  
Labels: Bugs, etc  
Assignee: @web-dev-team  

Set Up a Project Board:
Go to your repo → Projects → Create Project.
Add columns like To Do, In Progress, Review, Done.

Link Issues to PRs:
When creating a pull request, reference an issue with # (e.g., “Fixes #101”).
GitHub will auto-close the issue when the PR merges!


## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?

Common challenges 
Merge conflicts 
What happens:Two people edit the same file, and Git doesn`t know which version to keep.
Example: Me and a teammate both update config.json but in different ways. When you try to merge, Git throws a tantrum. 
Head "theme": "dark" to the main
Direct Commits to main
What Happens: You edit the main directly instead of using a branch. Now the whole project crashes.
Example: You quickly fix a typo in index.html on main, but accidentally delete a critical script tag.

Forgetting to Pull/Push
What Happens: You work offline for days, then realize your local code is outdated or missing teammates’ changes.
Example: You build a new feature, but your teammate already updated the same files. Now you’re stuck rewriting code.

Committing unnecessary files
What Happens: You upload massive files (like videos) or auto-generated folders (like node_modules).
Example: Your repo balloons to 10GB because you committed a videos/ folder. GitHub might even block you for hitting storage limits.

Vague Commit messages
What Happens: Messages like “fixed stuff” leave everyone (including future-you) clueless.
Example: A commit titled “update” could mean anything like a bug fix, a typo, or a nuclear launch code (okay, maybe not that last one).

Best practices to dodge disaster

Branch like a pro
Never work directly on main. Create a branch for every task:
git checkout -b fix/header-style # Clear branch name = less confusion  
Branches are your safety net. If you mess up, just delete the branch and it won’t affect the main.

Pull before you Push
Always grab the latest version of main before starting work:
git checkout main  
git pull origin main  # Sync with GitHub  
git checkout your-branch  
git merge main      # Update your branch  
It’s like checking the group chat before making plans, this avoids surprises.

Write Commit messages that help
Bad: git commit -m "fixed bug"
Good: git commit -m "Fix login button not responding on mobile (Issue #45)"
Pro Tip: Use theconventional Commits style:
feat: add user profile page  
fix: resolve image upload timeout error  
docs: update README installation guide  

Use .gitignore to block junk files
Create a .gitignore file to auto-exclude files like node_modules/, .env, or logs.
.gitignore example  
node_modules/  
.DS_Store  
*.log  
This will Keep your repo clean and fast.

Embrace Pull Requests (Even Solo!)
Rule: Merge your own branches via PRs. It forces you to review your code.
Example:
Finish a feature on feature/dark-mode.
Open a PR titled “Add dark mode toggle.”
Review your changes, add notes, then merge.

Practice Conflict Resolution
Step-by-Step Fix:
Run git status to see conflicting files.
Open the file, find the <<<<<<< markers.
Decide which code to keep (or blend both).
Delete the markers, save the file, then:
git add.  
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in config.json" 

Real-world scenarios

Scenario 1: The Forgotten Pull
Problem: You built a login form for 3 days, but your teammate updated the same files.
Solution: Pull main into your branch daily. Small conflicts are easier than a mega-mess.

Scenario 2: The Accidental 1GB Video Commit
Problem: You pushed a huge file, and GitHub rejects your next push.
Solution: Use git rm --cached big-video.mp4 to remove it, then add *.mp4 to .gitignore.
